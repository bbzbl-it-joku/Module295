# My DB Setup

Here I'm describing my DB setup for this Project.

- I have installed PostgreSQL-14 locally on the LAB-Machine.
The DB-User to use this DB is the default ``postgres`` User with the password ``postgres``.
- I have a DB called ``Module295-DB`` which hosts my Data. This DB exist on the DB Server when the Application is started.
- I also have some Sample Data that can be used to populate the data to have return values. This can be found in the ``./src/main/resources/data.sql``.
